If the directory with the package distribution does not contain the 'configure'
file, you will need to run 'autoreconf -i'. autoreconf is a part of autotools.

To compile Grapefruit:

 * 'cd' into the directory with the package distribution
 * Run './configure'
 * Run 'make'

If no errors have occurred, the program binary can be found in the folder src/.
To install Grapefruit after it has been compiled:

 * Run 'make install'

If you are interested in Grapefruit development, the recommended way is to use
gcc to compile it and instead of running './configure' in the second step, run
'./configure-gcc-dev'.
